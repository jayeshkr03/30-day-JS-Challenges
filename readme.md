# 15-Day JavaScript Mastery Challenge

Welcome to my 15-day JavaScript Mastery Challenge! This challenge was given to me as an intern at **Sparrow Softtech (Bhavnagar)** to help sharpen my JavaScript skills through daily hands-on tasks.

## About the Challenge

Over the course of 15 days, I am tackling a variety of JavaScript problems and mini-projects. Each day brings a new challenge, helping me build a strong foundation in JavaScript fundamentals and practical coding.

## Progress At a Glance

- Completed daily coding exercises covering topics like variables, functions, arrays, and objects.
- Built small projects such as calculators, to-do lists, and interactive web components.
- Practiced DOM manipulation and event handling.
- Improved problem-solving skills with algorithmic challenges.

Stay tuned as I continue to update this repository with new solutions and projects throughout the challenge!
