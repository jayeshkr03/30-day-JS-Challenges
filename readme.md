# 30-Day JavaScript Mastery Challenge

Welcome to my 30-day JavaScript Mastery Challenge! This challenge was given to me as an intern at **Sparrow Softtech (Bhavnagar)** to help sharpen my JavaScript skills through daily hands-on tasks.

## About the Challenge

Over the course of 30 days, I am tackling a variety of JavaScript problems and mini-projects. Each day brings a new challenge, helping me build a strong foundation in JavaScript fundamentals and practical coding.

## Progress At a Glance

- Mastered variables, data types, and operators.
- Practiced writing and using functions, including arrow functions.
- Explored arrays and objects, including sorting and searching algorithms.
- Built small projects: calculator, to-do list, and number guessing game.
- Implemented DOM manipulation and event handling.
- Solved algorithmic challenges: linear search, object sorting, and more.
- Used Node.js for command-line input and output.
- Improved code readability with console.table and clean output formatting.
